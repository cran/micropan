#' 
#' @description Computes the genomic fluidity, which is a measure of population diversity.
#' 
#' @param pan.matrix A pan-matrix, see \code{\link{panMatrix}} for details.
#' @param n.sim An integer specifying the number of random samples to use in the computations.
#' 
#' @details  The genomic fluidity between two genomes is defined as the number of unique gene
#' families divided by the total number of gene families (Kislyuk et al, 2011). This is averaged
#' over \samp{n.sim} random pairs of genomes to obtain a population estimate.
#' 
#' The genomic fluidity between two genomes describes their degree of overlap with respect to gene
#' cluster content. If the fluidity is 0.0, the two genomes contain identical gene clusters. If it
#' is 1.0 the two genomes are non-overlapping. The difference between a Jaccard distance (see
#' \code{\link{distJaccard}}) and genomic fluidity is small, they both measure overlap between
#' genomes, but fluidity is computed for the population by averaging over many pairs, while Jaccard
#' distances are computed for every pair. Note that only presence/absence of gene clusters are
#' considered, not multiple occurrences.
#' 
#' The input \samp{pan.matrix} is typically constructed by \code{\link{panMatrix}}.
#' 
#' @return A vector with two elements, the mean fluidity and its sample standard deviation over
#' the \samp{n.sim} computed values.

#' @name distManhattan
#' @title Computing Manhattan distances between genomes
#' 
#' @description Computes the (weighted) Manhattan distances beween all pairs of genomes.
#' 
#' @param pan.matrix A pan-matrix, see \code{\link{panMatrix}} for details.
#' @param scale An optional scale to control how copy numbers should affect the distances.
#' @param weights Vector of optional weights of gene clusters.
#' 
#' @details The Manhattan distance is defined as the sum of absolute elementwise differences between
#' two vectors. Each genome is represented as a vector (row) of integers in \samp{pan.matrix}. The
#' Manhattan distance between two genomes is the sum of absolute difference between these rows. If
#' two rows (genomes) of the \samp{pan.matrix} are identical, the corresponding Manhattan distance
#' is \samp{0.0}.
#' 
#' The \samp{scale} can be used to control how copy number differences play a role in the distances
#' computed. Usually we assume that going from 0 to 1 copy of a gene is the big change of the genome,
#' and going from 1 to 2 (or more) copies is less. Prior to computing the Manhattan distance, the
#' \samp{pan.matrix} is transformed according to the following affine mapping: If the original value in
#' \samp{pan.matrix} is \samp{x}, and \samp{x} is not 0, then the transformed value is \samp{1 + (x-1)*scale}.
#' Note that with \samp{scale=0.0} (default) this will result in 1 regardless of how large \samp{x} was.
#' In this case the Manhattan distance only distinguish between presence and absence of gene clusters.
#' If \samp{scale=1.0} the value \samp{x} is left untransformed. In this case the difference between 1
#' copy and 2 copies is just as big as between 1 copy and 0 copies. For any \samp{scale} between 0.0 and
#' 1.0 the transformed value is shrunk towards 1, but a certain effect of larger copy numbers is still
#' present. In this way you can decide if the distances between genomes should be affected, and to what
#' degree, by differences in copy numbers beyond 1. Notice that as long as \samp{scale=0.0} (and no
#' weighting) the Manhattan distance has a nice interpretation, namely the number of gene clusters that
#' differ in present/absent status between two genomes.
#' 
#' When summing the difference across gene clusters we can also up- or downweight some clusters compared
#' to others. The vector \samp{weights} must contain one value for each column in \samp{pan.matrix}. The
#' default is to use flat weights, i.e. all clusters count equal. See \code{\link{geneWeights}} for
#' alternative weighting strategies.

#' @title Gene cluster weighting

#' @description This function computes weights for gene cluster according to their distribution in a pan-genome.
#' 
#' @param pan.matrix A pan-matrix, see \code{\link{panMatrix}} for details.
#' @param type A text indicating the weighting strategy.
#' 
#' @details When computing distances between genomes or a PCA, it is possible to give weights to the
#' different gene clusters, emphasizing certain aspects.
#' 
#' As proposed by Snipen & Ussery (2010), we have implemented two types of weighting: The default
#' \samp{"shell"} type means gene families occuring frequently in the genomes, denoted shell-genes, are
#' given large weight (close to 1) while those occurring rarely are given small weight (close to 0).
#' The opposite is the \samp{"cloud"} type of weighting. Genes observed in a minority of the genomes are
#' referred to as cloud-genes. Presumeably, the \samp{"shell"} weighting will give distances/PCA reflecting
#' a more long-term evolution, since emphasis is put on genes who have just barely diverged away from the
#' core. The \samp{"cloud"} weighting emphasizes those gene clusters seen rarely. Genomes with similar
#' patterns among these genes may have common recent history. A \samp{"cloud"} weighting typically gives
#' a more erratic or \sQuote{noisy} picture than the \samp{"shell"} weighting.
#' 
#' @return A vector of weights, one for each column in \code{pan.matrix}.
