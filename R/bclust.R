#' @name bClust
#' @title Clustering sequences based on pairwise distances
#' 
#' @description Sequences are clustered by hierarchical clustering based on a set of pariwise distances.
#' The distances must take values between 0.0 and 1.0, and all pairs \emph{not} listed are assumed to
#' have distance 1.0.
#' 
#' @param dist.tbl A \code{tibble} with pairwise distances. 
#' @param linkage A text indicating what type of clustering to perform, either \samp{complete} (default),
#' \samp{average} or \samp{single}.
#' @param threshold Specifies the maximum size of a cluster. Must be a distance, i.e. a number between
#' 0.0 and 1.0.
#' @param verbose Logical, turns on/off text output during computations.
#' 
#' @details  Computing clusters (gene families) is an essential step in many comparative studies.
#' \code{\link{bClust}} will assign sequences into gene families by a hierarchical clustering approach.
#' Since the number of sequences may be huge, a full all-against-all distance matrix will be impossible
#' to handle in memory. However, most sequence pairs will have an \sQuote{infinite} distance between them,
#' and only the pairs with a finite (smallish) distance need to be considered.
#'
#' This function takes as input the distances in \code{dist.tbl} where only the relevant distances are
#' listed. The columns \samp{Query} and \samp{Hit} contain tags identifying pairs of sequences. The column
#' \samp{Distance} contains the distances, always a number from 0.0 to 1.0. Typically, this is the output
#' from \code{\link{bDist}}. All pairs of sequences \emph{not} listed are assumed to have distance 1.0,
#' which is considered the \sQuote{infinite} distance.
#' All sequences must be listed at least once in ceither column \samp{Query} or \samp{Hit} of the \code{dist.tbl}.
#' This should pose no problem, since all sequences must have distance 0.0 to themselves, and should be listed
#' with this distance once (\samp{Query} and \samp{Hit} containing the same tag). 
#' 
#' The \samp{linkage} defines the type of clusters produced. The \samp{threshold} indicates the size of
#' the clusters. A \samp{single} linkage clustering means all members of a cluster have at least one other
#' member of the same cluster within distance \samp{threshold} from itself. An \samp{average} linkage means
#' all members of a cluster are within the distance \samp{threshold} from the center of the cluster. A
#' \samp{complete} linkage means all members of a cluster are no more than the distance \samp{threshold}
#' away from any other member of the same cluster. 
#' 
#' Typically, \samp{single} linkage produces big clusters where members may differ a lot, since they are
#' only required to be close to something, which is close to something,...,which is close to some other
#' member. On the other extreme, \samp{complete} linkage will produce small and tight clusters, since all
#' must be similar to all. The \samp{average} linkage is between, but closer to \samp{complete} linkage. If
#' you want the \samp{threshold} to specify directly the maximum distance tolerated between two members of
#' the same gene family, you must use \samp{complete} linkage. The \samp{single} linkage is the fastest
#' alternative to compute. Using the default setting of \samp{single} linkage and maximum \samp{threshold}
#' (1.0) will produce the largest and fewest clusters possible.
#' 
#' @return The function returns a vector of integers, indicating the cluster membership of every unique
#' sequence from the \samp{Query} or \samp{Hit} columns of the input \samp{dist.tbl}. The name
#' of each element indicates the sequence. The numerical values have no meaning as such, they are simply
#' categorical indicators of cluster membership.

#' @name isOrtholog
#' @title Identifies orthologs in gene clusters
#' 
#' @description Finds the ortholog sequences in every cluster based on pairwise distances.
#' 
#' @param clustering A vector of integers indicating the cluster for every sequence. Sequences with
#' the same number belong to the same cluster. The name of each element is the tag identifying the sequence.
#' @param dist.tbl A \code{tibble} with pairwise distances. The columns \samp{Query} and
#' \samp{Hit} contain tags identifying pairs of sequences. The column \samp{Distance} contains the
#' distances, always a number from 0.0 to 1.0.
#' 
#' @details The input \code{clustering} is typically produced by \code{\link{bClust}}. The input
#' \code{dist.tbl} is typically produced by \code{\link{bDist}}.
#' 
#' The concept of orthologs is difficult for prokaryotes, and this function finds orthologs in a
#' simplistic way. For a given cluster, with members from many genomes, there is one ortholog from every
#' genome. In cases where a genome has two or more members in the same cluster, only one of these is an
#' ortholog, the rest are paralogs.
#' 
#' Consider all sequences from the same genome belonging to the same cluster. The ortholog is defined as
#' the one having the smallest sum of distances to all other members of the same cluster, i.e. the one
#' closest to the \sQuote{center} of the cluster.
#' 
#' Note that the status as ortholog or paralog depends greatly on how clusters are defined in the first
#' place. If you allow large and diverse (and few) clusters, many sequences will be paralogs. If you define
#' tight and homogenous (and many) clusters, almost all sequences will be orthologs.
#' 
#' @return A vector of logicals with the same number of elements as the input \samp{clustering}, indicating
#' if the corresponding sequence is an ortholog (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). The name of each
#' element is copied from \samp{clustering}.
